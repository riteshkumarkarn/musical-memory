# Media Player

### Description
This is an advanced music player for one's needs, elevated from legacy players like VLC and Windows Media Player with a beautiful GUI, built from scratch with Python, using ```Tkinter``` library for GUI, the ```OS``` library for file controls and ```Pygame``` library for media controls.
>**Currently the program only supports .mp3 files, and we are not willing to add other file extensions any soon.**

### Minimum system requirements
- OS: Any operating system with Python 3.x and the required libraries installed.
- Processor: Any **dual-core** processor.
  > The program uses two cores of your processor to run efficiently, and update information in real-time without disturbing the `mainloop`, so a dual-core processor is recommended.
- RAM: At least 2GB or above, DDR3 or above
- Permanent storage: Any storage type (SSD recommended)
  > The program needs to take and store information from the web as well as your storage, so it needs a good RPM storage device to ensure best performance, and at least 2GB of RAM to store temporary information efficiently.
- **You need an active internet connection in order to open the app, as it checks for updates the moment you start the app.**
